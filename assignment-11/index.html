            Malcom James McCormick A.K.A. Mac Miller was born in Point Breeze Pittsburgh on January 19, 1992. His Jewish and Christian parents sent him to a Catholic grade school to "ensure a good education and a chance to play football and lacrosse". But once he started rapping and released <i>But My Mackin' Ain't Easy</i> in 2007 at the age of 15 he realized this was going to be his career. Then, Mac spent the next two years releasing two mix tapes and attending Taylor Allderice High School. In august of 2010, barely two months after graduation Mac Miller gets his breakthrough moment when he released the <i>K. I. D. S. album.</i> (pictured above) Later this year Mac will wins awards at the Pittsburgh Hip-Hop Awards for <b>21 and Under</b> and <b>Video of the Year</b>.

            From 2010-13, Mac quickly finds himself in the studio with people such as Wiz Khalifa, Kendrick Lamar, and Meek Mill. Releasing several Billboard top 200 and 100 album chart music. During this time he released <i>Macadelic</i> with the song <i>Loud</i> which went <b>triple platinum</b>. My all-time favorite Mac Miller song is also on that album, it is called <i>The Question, ft. Lil Wayne</i>.

            Tragically, Mac Miller passed away 5 years later on Septembet 7th 2018. He took some pills laced with <i>fentanyl</i> a very dangerous drug being used to lace other drugs. Since then a posthumous album called Circles was released by his friends and family and then some of his other unreleased music was released as well but not as formally. Below is a link to his website I reccomend checking it out. I think it features an art style that personifies his flow and appearance. The world wept when Mac Miller passed away because -and I would like to say I am not alone in this thought- he stood out from the genre around him as unique. Able to rap on a variety of beats or change genres entirely. It is so unfortunate he was robbed of the opportunity to reach his potential as a person and an artist.
