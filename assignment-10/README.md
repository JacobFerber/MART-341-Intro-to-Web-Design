The scale of editing with a selector tag in CSS - from smallest to largest is ID, class, element, and universal. Id only edits one instance of a P whereas a element selector would affect every P tag in my code. Class selectors allows for a group of effects be applied to different tags and as along as the tag belongs to the same class selector affected tags should appear the same. I am not certain what the universal selector type does.

I aimed for a triadic color scheme but I felt that it was a little boring so i went for a double complimentary color scheme.

I really struggled with this week. Beingly completely candid, i watched your video and basically copied your code exactly as you wrote it. I had tons of problems getting content centered in the middle of my screen. When i used the display inline-block inside of div on my stylesheet it would screw everything up. So seriously after messing with this assignment for i think 5 days now I found someone taking this class and got help getting my assignment past the finishing line. I could not get my dots to work for me for the life of me and I found out it was due to that little chunck of code missing from my div. So i put it in the pallette tag and i think this was in your tutorial/my code at one time but I deleted it while troubleshooting and that caused a lot of problems.
