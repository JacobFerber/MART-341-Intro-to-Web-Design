The goal of my website is to have my own resume and create my own bibliography. I think sending a potential employer a WEBSITE to introduce my self would stand out. I also think that if I get an audience for my artwork this will serve as a way to direct them around my content.

A responsive website utilizes the viewers subconscious by highlighting areas their cursor is hovering over. Dropdown menus, informational images and videos can be played to keep people scrolling. Keeping content short and digestible helps as well.
