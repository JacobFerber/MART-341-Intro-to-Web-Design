 I have enjoyed getting used to the flow of html and the way it works. I feel like I have gained an understanding that I definitely didn't get from my previous classes. Meaning, when I go back and ckeck my work I really can look at everything on the page and accurately proof check it. My code works like all of the time now and less and less I need to check example code for the answer. Granted, it still saves me all the time and I imagine that will continue to be the case obviously. The most difficult part is remembering all the individual ways code can get edited to appear differently. For example, when attaching an immage you cant forget the alt,width, etc... 

 I am definitely a little afraid of next week I have not gotten a lot of time in CSS recently and I am definitely rusty. Hopefully the harder stuff comes later and we stay focused on what we have been doing it recently and make our pages look a lot bettter with CSS. Which it sounds like??
