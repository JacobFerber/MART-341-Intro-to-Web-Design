A directory is similiar to a table of contents. It lists all the folders (like chapters in a table of contents) and then it ranks them. Some folders are ranked equally with other folders because they exist at the same level in the hiearchy of the directory. Folders can be placed in other folders wich creates this hiearchy. Folders that are stored within other folders can only be accessed after opening the parent folder that stores them. 
VCS allow for team collaboration on a project. They keep track of versions and the changes to code so that errors are caught and dev's can analyze where a problem was introduced. They also can merge code together so team members have the freedom to edit any line of code anywhere and then commit it. The VCS will combine all the colaborators work to the same file. 
My favorite medium is cinematography because you can make an audience feel any emotion. This is capable through other mediums but since films are largely about the human condition and portrayed through actors. I feel like audiences connect with a film more than they can with a still photograph or painting. I think people are naturally drawn to watch TV more because of this connection and it is why I am drawn to this medium more than others.
