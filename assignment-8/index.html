        Road shimmer </br>
        Wiggling the vision</br>
        Heat heat waves</br>
        I'm swimming in a mirror</br>
        Road shimmer</br>
        Wiggling the vision</br>
        Heat heat waves</br>
        I'm swimming in a</br>
        Sometimes, all I think about is you</br>
        Late nights in the middle of June</br>
        Heat waves been faking me out</br>
        Can't make you happier now</br>
        Sometimes, all I think about is you</br>
        Late nights in the middle of June</br>
        Heat waves been faking me out</br>
        Can't make you happier now</br>
        Usually I put</br>
        Something on TV</br>
        So we never think</br>
        About you and me</br>
        But today I see</br>
        Our reflections</br>
        Clearly in Hollywood</br>
        Laying on the screen</br>
        You just need a better life than this</br>
        You need something I can never give</br>
        Fake water all across the road</br>
        It's gone now, the night has come, but</br>
        Sometimes, all I think about is you</br>
        Late nights in the middle of June</br>
        Heat waves been faking me out</br>
        Can't make you happier now</br>
        You can't fight it</br>
        You can't breathe</br>
        You say something so loving, but</br>
        Now I've got to let you go</br>
        You'll be better off in someone new</br>
        I don't wanna be alone</br>
        You know it hurts me too</br>
        You look so broken when you cry</br>
        One more and then I'll say goodbye</br>
        Sometimes, all I think about is you</br>
        Late nights in the middle of June</br>
        Heat waves been faking me out</br>
        Can't make you happier now</br>
        Sometimes, all I think about is you</br>
        Late nights in the middle of June</br>
        Heat waves been faking me out</br>
        Can't make you happier now</br>
        I just wonder what you're dreaming of</br>
        When you sleep and smile so comfortable</br>
        I just wish that I could give you that</br>
        That look that's perfectly un-sad</br>
        Sometimes, all I think about is you</br>
        Late nights in the middle of June</br>
        Heat waves been faking me out</br>
        Heat waves been faking me out</br>
        Sometimes, all I think about is you</br>
