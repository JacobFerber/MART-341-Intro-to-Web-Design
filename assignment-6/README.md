Structural markups, guide a users experience on a website by organizing chunks of information by using headers/paragraphs/lists or breaks. This allows the user to quickly and painlessly find information related to each other.
Semantic markups guide the users experience within the structural markups. Meaning as a user skims a paragraphs or list for specific information, it may stand out amongst the other words because it has been bolded or italicized. This is the application of Semantic markups.
