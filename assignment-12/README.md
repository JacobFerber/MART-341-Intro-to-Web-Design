The difference between border margin and padding is borders draw a line with specified thickness around the element you style it in with a fill of your choice as well. Padding does this in a similiar fashion but instead this border is more of an invisible layer meant to just relocate the element to be somewhere more vissually appealing. Margins do not draw anything but set a guideline for elements to act within those borders.

This weeks assignment went well I had to edit my old code to update it with my new knowledge of how margins and padding work. I am still struggling to get my images centered i tried something new but it doesn't work. The other thing that bothers me is the buttons are too small for the dropdown. I am curious how I can make these match. I might just come in for office hours because I also struggled with the footer being smaller than I wished as well.
